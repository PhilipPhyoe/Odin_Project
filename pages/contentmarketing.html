            It’s not about pushing. It’s pulling and nurturing loyal customers. It’s a way of providing educational, motivational, and inspirational emotions to customers.
            Have you ever shared some contents that reflect your daily life? That’s kind of content marketing. If one content can’t reflect anything in life, it is useless to attract customers. In a creative digital marketing agency like Efectivee, content marketing starts with buyer personas creation. Then next steps are contents mapping and contents production. Finally, we measure the results. There are a wide range of contents. Blog posts, Facebook status, Brand Videos, Short Stories and commercial ads are all contents.
            A brand should create an attractive content that appeals to its target audience.
